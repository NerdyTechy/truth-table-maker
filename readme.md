# Truth Table Generator
Command line truth table generator that takes word-based logical expressions and generates a nice table to help you to understand them.

## Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NerdyTechy/truth-table-maker # clone the repo
cd truth-table-maker
npm install # install required packages
tsc # compile typescript
npm install -g . # install the project as a global package
truth-table "a or b and c or d" # use anywhere
```

## Why?
I didn't want to spend 5 minutes writing out a truth tables manually at uni, so I spent 5 hours making a program to do it for me

## What logical operators are supported?
AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR

## Is it always right?
Probably not, it was only made for basic tables so if you need to understand some super complicated or important logic then this probably doesn't fit your needs

## Can I use this for _____?
Yes.

## Can I contribute?
Sure, if you want to add something or fix something that's inevitably broken then go ahead!
